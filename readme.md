# CPP Blackjack Game

## Application Tools

-   g++
-   cmake/make
-   googletest
-   Doxygen

## Algorithm Considerations

1. How will you calculate a players hand if an Ace, or even several Aces, can be a 1 or 11, depending on if it helps the user's score?

2. How will the game decide on if a player, or many players, will take another card or not if the game runs without user input?

3. How will the application decide who wins the game, who ties, who is busted?

4. How many player can there be?
